Dear user, in this directory you will find some of the codebase for our project, consisting of a .msapp file of the STARS Admin Application GUI.

Microsoft Power Apps are created and used inside Microsoft 365, so they are not standalone programs that can be downloaded, installed, and run independently. However, this file can allow you to view the GUI in the Canvas editor.

You can open this file of the GUI by:
1. Open Microsoft Power Apps from the Microsoft application menu from Outlook 365
2. In the left hand menu, click "apps"
3. Create a new, blank Canvas app
4. In the editor, click on the "..." in the top menu and then click "open"
5. Find and open the .msapp file in your file system.
NOTE: Do not use the "import" button. This will prompt you to upload a .zip file of an exported solution, not a .msapp file.

The above process may not import Power Automate Flows from my project. 

The videos and documentation contained in this repository show the full extent and function of the app.
